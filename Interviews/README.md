## General Notes (My Dumbo Moments)
- Remember to check if you have to return something 
- Remember in place vs returned 
- Check spelling errors
- While doing a while loop with an iterator. Don't forget to increment it.
- If you are interating through a matrix. Remember both parts of the array.
- `Remember to check variable names and constant values to be correct`
- More test cases
- Check edge cases
- Divide and Conquer when you can (Sorting)
- When computing large numbers, go to binary
- Make sure your code does what your notes do
