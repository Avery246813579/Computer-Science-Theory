# Data Structures

This file contains all the information you should know about data
structures.

## ArrayList
A list that has random indexing.

- Get O(1): Constaint because you check the memory address
- Push O(1): Constant besides when the array gets bigger but average constant
- Find O(n): Need to loop through and find it
- Prepend O(n): Linear because you have to move every element right by one
- Remove O(n): Worst case O(n) because you have to shift

## Linked List
A list that has nodes that reference the next node

- Get O(n): Need to find it
- Add O(1): Plop it on the end
- Find O(n): Loop through to find it
-

## HashMap
- Get O(1)
- Contains O(1)
- Find (1)
- Iterate (Yeah right)

## Hash Set
- Get O (n)
- Contains O (1)

## Hash Bag (MultiSet)
- Get O(n)
