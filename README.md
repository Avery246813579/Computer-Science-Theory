# Computer-Science-Theory

This is a project that shows theoretical and applied computer science
concepts. This project is mainly for my learning but can be used as a
resource for others.

All of my topics will include a README.md that details how the concept
works theoretically then two python files. One file will be the concept
in code, the other file will be a test file.

## Topics

All of these topics will be covered. If there is no link to the topic
then I have not gotten to it yet.
